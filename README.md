# Attention
###### In order to use the project it is necessary to make some changes. 
In *Pages / vendor / fontawesome-free* the svgs.zip file needs to be unzipped.

There is a native application already exported (for MacOS) in the DLM-darwin-x64 zip file.

Furthermore, **there is no folder containing the packages (node_modules folder), as they must be installed locally**.
